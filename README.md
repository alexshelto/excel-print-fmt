# excel-print-fmt
### Backstory
I was tasked with the duty of moving all spreadsheet data to a new web site where the information would be inputted in a singular 'notes' field. 
This script can remove some of the manual labor allowing me to just copy and paste the information over which is way faster than typing everything.  

## What does this do?
* formats and prints excel spread sheet cell data by row
* allows user to exclude certain columns from output

## Usage
```python3 main.py filename
python3 main.py filename --exclude 1 2 4
```
optional argument: -e/--exclude, column numbers to exclude from formatted print

### Example on test sheet in /test
```python3 main.py test.xlsx -e 1 2```

first 2 rows out output: 
```
excluding columns: ['last date modified', 'cost']
